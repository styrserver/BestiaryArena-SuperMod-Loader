== Installation ==
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bestiaryarena-supermod-loader/ Firefox] installation:

[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bestiaryarena-supermod-lo/hloidpjbdbbhhkihgeeddnofmpgbffjd Chromium] installation: 

== Alternative Installation ==

=== Firefox Installation (Alternative) ===
# Download the extension files from the [https://github.com/styrserver/BestiaryArena-SuperMod-Loader GitHub repository]
# Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file
# Open Firefox and navigate to <code>about:debugging</code>
# Click "This Firefox" tab
# Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the <code>manifest_firefox.json</code> file

=== Chromium Installation (Alternative) ===
# Download the extension files from the [https://github.com/styrserver/BestiaryArena-SuperMod-Loader GitHub repository]
# Unzip the files to a location on your computer

# Go to <code>chrome://extensions/</code> in your browser
# Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
# Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
# The extension icon should now appear in your browser toolbar

== Using the Mod Loader ==
After installing the extension, navigate to [https://bestiaryarena.com/ Bestiary Arena]. The extension will automatically inject its code into the game page.

To access the Mod Loader interface, click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

=== Extension Popup Interface ===
The extension provides a user-friendly popup interface for managing your mods. The popup interface allows you to enable/disable mods and access configuration options quickly.

=== Loading Mods ===
There are two ways to load mods:
# '''Local Mods''': Place mod JavaScript files in the <code>mods/</code> directory and they will be available for loading.
# '''Gist Mods''': Enter a GitHub Gist hash ID in the mod loader interface to load a mod from GitHub.

=== Managing Mods ===
You can enable, disable, and configure mods from the mod loader interface. Each mod can have its own configuration settings, which are saved between sessions.

== Mod Development ==
Mods can be written in JavaScript and have access to the game's state and a powerful API for interacting with the game. See the Mod Development Guide for detailed information on creating mods.

=== Basic Mod Template ===
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
// My First Mod
console.log('My First Mod initializing...');

// Create a button in the UI
api.ui.addButton({
  id: 'my-first-mod-button',
  text: 'My Mod',
  tooltip: 'Click to show a message',
  primary: false,
  onClick: function() {
    api.ui.components.createModal({
      title: 'My First Mod',
      content: '<p>Hello from my first mod!</p>',
      buttons: [
        {
          text: 'OK',
          primary: true
        }
      ]
    });
  }
});

console.log('My First Mod initialization complete');
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Standardized UI Components ===
The extension provides a set of UI components that match the game's style. These components ensure a consistent look and feel across all mods:
* '''Modals''': Game-styled dialog windows
* '''Scrollable Containers''': For content that exceeds the viewable area
* '''Monster Portraits''': Display monsters with proper styling
* '''Item Portraits''': Display items with proper styling
* '''Room List Items''': Display rooms with proper styling
* '''Navigation Breadcrumbs''': For hierarchical navigation

Example of using UI components:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
// Create a monster portrait
const monsterPortrait = api.ui.components.createMonsterPortrait({
  monsterId: 21,  // Monster ID
  level: 50,      // Monster level
  tier: 4,        // Monster tier (1-5)
  onClick: () => showMonsterDetails(21)
});
</syntaxhighlight>

* Player stats and inventory
