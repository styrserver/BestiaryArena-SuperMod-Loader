# Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file
# Open Firefox and navigate to <code>about:debugging</code>
# Click "This Firefox" tab
# Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the <code>manifest_firefox.json</code> file

=== Chromium Installation (Alternative) ===

== Using the Mod Loader ==
After installing the extension, navigate to [https://bestiaryarena.com/ Bestiary Arena]. The extension will automatically inject its code into the game page.

To access the Mod Loader interface, click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

=== Extension Popup Interface ===
The extension provides a user-friendly popup interface for managing your mods. The popup interface allows you to enable/disable mods and access configuration options quickly.

=== Loading Mods ===
There are two ways to load mods:
# '''Local Mods''': Place mod JavaScript files in the <code>mods/</code> directory and they will be available for loading.
# '''Gist Mods''': Enter a GitHub Gist hash ID in the mod loader interface to load a mod from GitHub.

=== Managing Mods ===
You can enable, disable, and configure mods from the mod loader interface. Each mod can have its own configuration settings, which are saved between sessions.

== Mod Development ==
Mods can be written in JavaScript and have access to the game's state and a powerful API for interacting with the game. See the Mod Development Guide for detailed information on creating mods.



=== Standardized UI Components ===
The extension provides a set of UI components that match the game's style. These components ensure a consistent look and feel across all mods:

Example of using UI components:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
// Create a monster portrait
const monsterPortrait = api.ui.components.createMonsterPortrait({
  monsterId: 21,  // Monster ID
  level: 50,      // Monster level
  tier: 4,        // Monster tier (1-5)
  onClick: () => showMonsterDetails(21)
});
</syntaxhighlight>
